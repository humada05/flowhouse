        We're a multi-cultural team from around the world! We come from diverse
        backgrounds, bringing different personalities, experiences and skills to
        the job. This is what makes our team so special.

          I'm backend and data engineer with experience building reliable systems that move and transform data at scale.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
          I spent almost 6 years at Fivetran, where I helped design and grow our database replication products, eventually serving thousands of customers. My work spanned everything from Change Data Capture pipelines to performance tuning and connector architecture. I also built internal tooling and dev environments that helped our team ship faster and more reliably.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Since then, I’ve taken that experience into new challenges — designing high-performance backend systems and data infrastructure for healthcare at Serif Health, and now working independently to help startups build and scale their data systems.
